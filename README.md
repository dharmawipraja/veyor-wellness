### How to run this demo

In case my demo web is down (currently use Vercel free version) you can build and run it in your local machine

- Clone this repo into your local machine
- Install the dependencies (For this project I use `pnpm`, but you can use other package manager like `npm` or `yarn`. Just make sure to delete the `.lock` file first to avoid conflict lock file)
- Run the development version `(pnpm dev)`
<br/> or
- Run the production version `(pnpm build)` and `(pnpm preview)` after the build finish
- Open the URL in your browser
